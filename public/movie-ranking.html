<h1>The Best Movies According to Wouter</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>Masterpiece of a film. Old black and white film from 1957. The whole film takes place in one room, but despite of that never becomes boring.
    The acting is excellent, and the way the film develops is out of this world. 
</p>

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>More modern "crime" film from 2017. It tells the story of a getaway driver obsessed with music.
The choice of music in this film is excellent, and really ties well with the story.
</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>All-time classic by Tarantino. The way he writes his script, where even a conversation about a hamburger becomes interesting, is legendary.
The acting by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta is iconic as well.
